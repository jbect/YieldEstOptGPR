# YieldEstOptGPR

- This is an algorithm for the efficient and reliable estimation of a yield (= percentage of accepted realizations in a manufacturing process under uncertainties). 

- As benchmark problem a simple dielectrical waveguide is considered. 

- For yield estimation a hybrid method combining pure Monte Carlo (MC) with a surrogate model approach based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) is used.

- The main file to run the yield estimation is Run_YieldEst_Waveguide.py.

- A detailed description of the method and numercial results can be found in arXiv:2003.13278.

- The model of the waveguide comes from...
